# **Project Title: Task Manager Application**

## **Project Description:**

Create a task manager application that allows users to manage their tasks, including adding, updating, and removing tasks. This project will help you practice working with data structures, user interfaces, and file I/O.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Task List:** The application should display a list of tasks with details such as task name, due date, priority, and status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).

2. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks with relevant details. This might include specifying the task name, due date, priority level, and status.

3. **Edit Task:** Users can edit existing tasks, including updating task details or changing the task's status.

4. **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

5. **Save and Load:** Implement the ability to save and load tasks from a file, allowing users to persist their task list between sessions.

6. **Sorting and Filtering:** Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date, priority) and apply filters to view tasks by status (e.g., all tasks, to-do, in progress, completed).

7. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create a user-friendly console or GUI interface to interact with the application.

### **Optional Features:**

8. **Reminders:** Implement a feature that allows users to set reminders for upcoming tasks.

9. **Categories or Labels:** Allow users to categorize tasks or add labels for better organization.

10. **Search:** Add a search feature that lets users find specific tasks by name or other criteria.

11. **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts and authentication for privacy and security.

### **Challenges:**

- Design the data structure for storing tasks efficiently.
- Manage input validation to prevent errors and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Implement file I/O for saving and loading tasks.
- Develop efficient sorting and filtering algorithms for tasks.

This project will give you valuable experience in working with data structures, user interfaces, file handling, and more. You can start with the basic features and progressively add more advanced functionalities as you become more comfortable with C#.

Remember that the complexity of the project can vary based on your skill level, so feel free to adapt it to your current proficiency in C#. Good luck with your project!.
##  STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
Creating a task manager application is a significant project that involves various aspects of C# programming, including data structures, user interfaces, and file handling. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

**Step 1: Project Setup**
1. Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C# development (e.g., Visual Studio).
2. Create a new C# console application project or a Windows Forms application project, depending on whether you want a command-line or graphical user interface.

**Step 2: Define Task Class**
1. Create a `Task` class to represent individual tasks. This class should include properties like task name, due date, priority, and status.
2. Implement constructors, properties, and methods to work with tasks, such as updating task details.

**Step 3: Create Data Structures**
1. Use data structures to store and manage tasks. You can choose from options like arrays, lists, or custom collections.
2. Design efficient data structures to handle task storage and retrieval.

**Step 4: User Interface**
1. Design the user interface for your application. If you're using a console application, create a text-based menu system. For Windows Forms, design forms with buttons and input fields.
2. Implement menus or buttons for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing tasks.

**Step 5: Task Management**
1. Implement functionality to add tasks. Capture task details from the user (task name, due date, priority, status) and create new `Task` objects.
2. Implement functionality to edit tasks. Allow users to update task properties.
3. Implement functionality to delete tasks.

**Step 6: Sorting and Filtering**
1. Add sorting and filtering options to your application. For example, allow users to sort tasks by due date or priority.
2. Implement filters to view tasks by status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).

**Step 7: File I/O**
1. Implement file I/O for saving and loading tasks. This allows users to persist their task list between sessions.
2. Use C# file handling methods to read and write task data to a file.

**Step 8: Testing and Debugging**
1. Test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Verify that tasks are added, edited, and deleted correctly.
2. Handle exceptions gracefully and provide user-friendly error messages.

**Step 9: Optional Features**
1. Consider implementing optional features such as reminders, categories, labels, and search functionality, depending on your project's complexity and your skill level.

**Step 10: User Documentation**
1. Provide user documentation or instructions on how to use your application. Explain the features and how to perform various actions.

**Step 11: Iteration and Improvement**
1. Continuously improve and refine your application based on user feedback and your evolving skills.

Remember to break down the project into manageable tasks, focus on one feature at a time, and test your application as you go along. You can start with a basic version and gradually add more features and enhancements to make your task manager application more powerful and user-friendly.

Throughout the development process, you may refer to C# documentation and online resources for guidance on specific coding techniques and C# libraries. It's also a good opportunity to practice your problem-solving skills and enhance your understanding of C# programming.
